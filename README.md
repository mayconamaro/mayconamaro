### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Computer Science graduate, passionate about formal methods, functional programming and theoretical foundations of programming languages. I *love* compilers! In the free time Iâ€™m reading graphic design books, having fun with some basic CTFs and playing games. I hope you enjoy my github profileâ€”it was made with love ðŸ¥°.

My pronouns are he/him.
