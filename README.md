### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Maycon Amaro, and Iâ€™m a MSc in Computer Science and a temporary professor at Federal University of Ouro Preto. Iâ€™m passionate about formal methods, functional programming and theoretical foundations, design and implementation of programming languages. I **love** compilers! I hope you enjoy my github profile.
