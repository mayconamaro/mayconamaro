### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Maycon Amaro, a brazilian MSc in Computer Science and a former professor at the Federal University of Ouro Preto. Currently, I work as a Software Development Engineer in Test at a payments company. 

I **love** compilers! And that includes:
- formal methods
- functional programming
- type theory
- design and implementation of programming languages
- standard libraries
